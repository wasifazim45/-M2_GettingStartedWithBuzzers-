+  * when the relay will switch on the buzzer, then the buzzer will make a sound.
+  * After run in the simulation mode, we can see that led is getting blinking.
+  * Here we have send the values on the port D   0 to 250. so according to that led are turning on and off.
+  * Here we can also observes some buzzers sound also.
+  * In a simple way we can see that, when the voltage at controller pin is high the led will be turned on and when the voltage will be low the led will be turned off.
